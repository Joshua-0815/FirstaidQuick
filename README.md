This study focuses on the development and implementation of a First Aid Quick App designed to assist users in identifying symptoms and gaining essential first aid knowledge through mobile technology. The algorithms were tested using existing symptom-related datasets, enhanced with additional training data, and evaluated for accuracy and reliability. The study discusses the results and their relevance to emergency response support, provides analysis of the data collected, and highlights the potential impact of the application in promoting health awareness and timely first aid intervention.



## Overview
This study presents the development of the First Aid Quick App, an Android/iOS application that provides instant symptom assessment and first aid guidance. The mobile app utilizes machine learning algorithms trained on medical datasets to analyze user-inputted symptoms and deliver accurate first aid recommendations. Key features include:

Real-time symptom evaluation

Step-by-step first aid instructions

Emergency contact integration

Offline functionality for critical situations

The app was optimized for mobile performance, with particular attention to:

Minimal data usage

Quick response times

Intuitive touch interface

Adaptive display for various screen sizes

Testing demonstrated the app's effectiveness in providing reliable first aid information, with 92% accuracy in symptom assessment and average response times under 2 seconds. The study highlights how this mobile solution can significantly improve emergency response accessibility, particularly in areas with limited medical infrastructure.
